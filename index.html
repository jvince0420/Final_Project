                <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
                <p>The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) is located in Laoag City, with an external campus in Paoay, Ilocos Norte. It was
                chosen in 1983 as one of the 21 public technological institutes in the Technical Vocational Education Project (TVEP) of the then
                Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) mandated to produce the needed manpower for industrial growth and
                development in the country.</p>
                <p>The college was an accredited regional trade skills training and testing center in Region 1 by the Technical Education and Skills
                Development Authority (TESDA) and a regional training center in ceramic by the Product Design and Development Center of
                the Philippines.</p>
                <p>It also hosts a Toyota Technology Center (TTC), one among 18 established in nominated partner schools in the country under
                the Toyota Automotive Education Program (TAEP) of the Toyota Motor Philippines Foundation (TMPF) Inc., which is envisioned
                to become the regional skills development center in automotive servicing.</p>
                <p>The University is Deputized by CHED to implement the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program
                (ETEEAP) with the BS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY as one of the ETEEAP Degree Programs offered by the College. The ETEEAP is
                a comprehensive educational assessment program at the tertiary level that recognizes, accredits, and gives equivalencies to
                knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values gained by individuals from relevant work. This program recognizes that education and
                the acquisition of higher expertise also take place beyond the confines of the classroom. The BSIT degree may be granted to
                individuals through the recognition of their knowledge and skills gained from non-formal or informal learning. The recognition
                of the knowledge and skills are done through equivalency and assessment by assessors of the College.</p>

                <h2>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p>The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) was formerly the college department of the Ilocos Norte College of Arts and Trades
                (INCAT) in Laoag City which was integrated into the university by P.D. 1279 or the decree creating the Mariano Marcos State
                University.</p>
                <p>Upon its integration into the University, the College was originally named the Institute of Industrial Technology (IIT). 
                Engineering and business administration courses were offered in 1983 which paved the way for the renaming of the college
                to the Institute of Technology (IT).  The three-year non-degree Diploma of Industrial Technology (DIT) program, which was
                later renamed the Diploma of Technology (DT), was offered in 1985. </p>
                <p>In 1986, the engineering courses were transferred to the Batac Campus with the creation of the College of Engineering, and
                the business administration courses towards the establishment of the College of Economics and Management (CEM), now the
                College of Business, Economics, and Accountancy (CBEA) also at the main campus.</p>
                <p>The College was renamed in 1995 to the College of Technology (COT).  To focus on tertiary education, a reengineering of the
                DT and GRCO non-degree programs was instituted in June 2004, which resulted in the development of a ladderized
                curriculum towards the four-year BSIT program.  The College was later renamed in 2004 to College of Industrial Technology
                (CIT) to reflect the college's role of providing education and training in specific fields of industrial technology.</p>
